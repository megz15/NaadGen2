    <p>Welcome to NaadGen! This app is a work in progress nearing completion (finally). As a solo developer in my third year, it takes time and effort to realize a polished version.</p>
    <p>I "resume" work on this and other past projects in my limited free time after inevitable hiatuses, most of which is spent refactoring and fixing breaking changes in an endless Sisyphean cycle :)</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy using this as much as I did making it! If you find bugs or have suggestions for improvement, <a href="https://github.com/megz15/swaranjali-web/issues" class="text-blue-600" target="_blank">reach out via a GitHub issue by clicking here.</a></p>
    <p>PS Old save files <strike>might</strike> would not be compatible as the project progresses till a stable milestone is reached.</p>
    <p>~ Meghraj</p>
